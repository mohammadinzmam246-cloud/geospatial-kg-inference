    <h1>Research Methodology</h1>
    <p>
        Ontology engineering, knowledge graph construction,
        and machine learning–based inference for geospatial data
    </p>
</header>

<!-- ================= METHODOLOGY OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section show">
    <h2>Methodology Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed methodology adopts a systematic and layered approach to enable
        semantic inference from large-scale geospatial datasets. It integrates
        ontology engineering, knowledge graph modeling, and machine learning–based
        rule induction to ensure reliable, explainable, and scalable inference.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each stage of the methodology is designed to address specific challenges
        associated with geospatial big data, including heterogeneity, semantic
        ambiguity, and limited interpretability of conventional data-driven models.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 1 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 1: Geospatial Data Collection and Preprocessing</h2>
    <p>
        The first step involves the acquisition of geospatial data from heterogeneous
        sources such as satellite imagery, sensor-based observations, spatial
        databases, and publicly available geospatial repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
        Preprocessing techniques are applied to clean, normalize, and structure the
        data. This includes handling missing values, spatial alignment, coordinate
        system normalization, and transformation of raw data into formats suitable
        for semantic modeling.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 2 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 2: Ontology Design and Semantic Modeling</h2>
    <p>
        In this step, domain-specific ontologies are designed to formally represent
        geospatial entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. Ontology
        engineering ensures that domain knowledge is explicitly captured in a
        machine-interpretable form.
    </p>

    <p>
        The ontology serves as a conceptual backbone for integrating heterogeneous
        datasets and provides semantic consistency across different data sources.
        It also enables reasoning and validation through well-defined classes,
        properties, and axioms.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 3 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 3: Knowledge Graph Construction</h2>
    <p>
        The ontology-based models are transformed into a geospatial knowledge graph,
        where entities and relationships are represented as interconnected triples.
        This structured representation enables efficient storage, querying, and
        traversal of semantic relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
        The knowledge graph integrates both spatial and non-spatial attributes,
        allowing contextual relationships to be captured and utilized during the
        inference process.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 4 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 4: Machine Learning–Based Inference Rule Learning</h2>
    <p>
        Machine learning techniques are employed to learn inference rules from the
        structured knowledge graph. These rules aim to identify hidden patterns,
        correlations, and implicit relationships that are not directly observable
        in the raw data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The learned rules are designed to complement semantic reasoning by enhancing
        inference capability while preserving interpretability and domain constraints.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 5 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 5: Semantic Reasoning and Knowledge Inference</h2>
    <p>
        The learned inference rules are imposed on the knowledge graph to infer new
        facts and relationships. Semantic reasoning mechanisms ensure that inferred
        knowledge remains consistent with the ontology constraints and domain logic.
    </p>

    <p>
        This hybrid inference strategy combines symbolic reasoning with data-driven
        learning, resulting in reliable and explainable inference outcomes.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 6 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 6: Evaluation and Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The inferred knowledge is evaluated using qualitative and quantitative
        measures to assess accuracy, consistency, and reliability. Comparative
        analysis is performed against traditional machine learning approaches
        to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
    </p>

    <p>
        Performance metrics such as inference accuracy, scalability, and response
        time are analyzed to validate the applicability of the approach to
        real-world geospatial scenarios.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= STEP 7 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Step 7: Web-Based System Implementation</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, a web-based inference framework is developed to visualize and
        interact with the geospatial knowledge graph and inferred results. The
        system provides an intuitive interface for exploring semantic relationships
        and understanding inference outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
        This implementation serves as a proof-of-concept and facilitates practical
        demonstration, validation, and dissemination of the proposed research.

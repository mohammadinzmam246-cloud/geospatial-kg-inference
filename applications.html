    <p>
        Real-world use cases of ontology-driven
        knowledge graph inference for geospatial data
    </p>
</header>

<!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section show">
    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The proposed ontology-driven knowledge graph inference framework
        has wide applicability across multiple domains that rely on
        geospatial data analysis. By integrating semantic reasoning with
        machine learning, the framework enables reliable, interpretable,
        and scalable decision support.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following applications demonstrate how semantic inference
        can enhance traditional geospatial analytics and support
        complex, real-world problem-solving.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= APPLICATION 1 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Smart City Planning and Urban Development</h2>
    <p>
        In smart city environments, large volumes of heterogeneous
        geospatial data are generated from sensors, transportation
        systems, and urban infrastructure. The proposed framework
        enables semantic integration of these datasets to support
        informed urban planning and development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ontology-driven inference allows decision-makers to analyze
        spatial relationships between land use, transportation
        networks, population density, and infrastructure, resulting
        in more sustainable and efficient urban development strategies.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= APPLICATION 2 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Environmental Monitoring and Climate Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Environmental monitoring involves continuous analysis of
        geospatial data related to air quality, water resources,
        land cover, and climate variables. Semantic modeling ensures
        consistent representation of environmental entities and processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The knowledge graph–based inference framework enables discovery
        of hidden environmental patterns and supports early detection
        of environmental risks, contributing to better climate
        impact assessment and policy formulation.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= APPLICATION 3 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Disaster Management and Risk Assessment</h2>
    <p>
        Disaster management requires timely and accurate interpretation
        of geospatial data from multiple sources, including satellite
        imagery, sensor networks, and historical disaster records.
    </p>

    <p>
        The proposed framework supports semantic reasoning to identify
        vulnerable regions, predict potential impacts, and assist
        emergency response planning, thereby enhancing preparedness
        and mitigation strategies.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= APPLICATION 4 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Land Use and Urban Growth Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Understanding land-use dynamics and urban expansion is
        essential for sustainable development. The ontology-driven
        approach enables semantic classification and analysis of
        land-use patterns over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        By integrating spatial and temporal relationships within a
        knowledge graph, the framework supports long-term urban growth
        analysis and evidence-based land management decisions.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= APPLICATION 5 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Decision Support Systems</h2>
    <p>
        The integration of semantic reasoning and machine learning
        facilitates the development of intelligent decision support
        systems for geospatial applications.
    </p>

    <p>
        These systems provide interpretable recommendations based on
        inferred knowledge, enabling domain experts to make informed
        decisions with higher confidence and transparency.

    <h1>Future Work</h1>
    <p>
        Potential research extensions and advancements
        for ontology-driven geospatial inference
    </p>
</header>

<!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section class="section show">
    <h2>Future Research Directions</h2>
    <p>
        While the proposed framework establishes a strong foundation for
        ontology-driven knowledge graph inference, several research
        directions can further enhance its applicability, scalability,
        and intelligence. Future work focuses on extending the framework
        to handle more complex data characteristics and advanced reasoning
        paradigms.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= FUTURE 1 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Integration with Real-Time Geospatial Data</h2>
    <p>
        One important extension involves integrating real-time and
        streaming geospatial data sources such as IoT sensors and live
        satellite feeds. This would enable dynamic knowledge graph updates
        and near real-time inference.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such integration would significantly enhance the framework’s
        applicability to time-sensitive applications including disaster
        monitoring, traffic management, and environmental surveillance.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= FUTURE 2 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</h2>
    <p>
        Current work primarily focuses on spatial semantics. Future research
        can extend the ontology and inference mechanisms to incorporate
        temporal dimensions, enabling spatio-temporal reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>
        This would allow analysis of changes over time, trend detection,
        and prediction of future spatial events, which are crucial for
        urban growth analysis and climate studies.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= FUTURE 3 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Deep Learning–Assisted Rule Generation</h2>
    <p>
        Another promising direction is the integration of deep learning
        techniques to assist in automated rule generation. Deep models
        can capture complex patterns that may not be easily expressed
        through traditional rule-based systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Combining deep learning with symbolic reasoning can further
        improve inference accuracy while maintaining explainability
        through ontology-based constraints.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= FUTURE 4 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Scalability and Large-Scale Deployment</h2>
    <p>
        Future work includes extensive scalability testing on large
        national or global geospatial datasets. This involves optimizing
        knowledge graph storage, distributed inference, and parallel
        processing strategies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Such efforts are essential to ensure that the framework can be
        deployed in real-world, high-volume geospatial environments.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= FUTURE 5 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Interoperability and Standardization</h2>
    <p>
        Enhancing interoperability with existing geospatial standards
        and platforms is another important research direction. Aligning
        the framework with international standards ensures wider adoption
        and seamless data exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
        This will enable integration with external systems and foster
        collaboration across research and industrial domains.

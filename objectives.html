    <h1>Project Objectives</h1>
    <p>
        Defining clear research goals for ontology-driven
        knowledge graph inference from geospatial big data
    </p>
</header>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE 1 ================= -->
<section class="section show">
    <h2>Objective 1: Ontology-Based Representation of Geospatial Data</h2>
    <p>
        The first objective of this research is to formally represent heterogeneous
        geospatial data using domain-specific ontologies. Geospatial datasets often
        originate from diverse sources such as satellite imagery, sensor networks,
        and spatial databases, each with distinct formats and semantics.
    </p>

    <p>
        By designing well-structured ontologies, spatial entities, attributes,
        relationships, and constraints can be explicitly defined. This semantic
        representation enables meaningful integration of multi-source data and
        provides a common conceptual framework for further reasoning and analysis.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE 2 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Objective 2: Construction of a Geospatial Knowledge Graph</h2>
    <p>
        The second objective focuses on transforming ontology-based representations
        into a large-scale geospatial knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs enable
        structured storage of entities and their relationships in the form of
        interconnected triples, facilitating efficient querying and reasoning.
    </p>

    <p>
        This objective aims to develop methods for mapping geospatial data instances
        to ontology concepts and relationships, resulting in a unified and
        semantically enriched knowledge graph that captures both spatial and
        contextual information.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE 3 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Objective 3: Learning and Applying Inference Rules</h2>
    <p>
        A key objective of this research is to design machine learning techniques
        capable of learning inference rules from data encoded in the knowledge graph.
        These rules aim to uncover implicit relationships and hidden patterns that
        are not explicitly present in the raw datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        The learned rules are imposed on the knowledge graph to infer new knowledge
        while preserving semantic consistency. This hybrid approach combines the
        strengths of symbolic reasoning and data-driven learning to enhance
        inference accuracy and reliability.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE 4 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Objective 4: Reliable and Explainable Knowledge Extraction</h2>
    <p>
        This objective focuses on extracting reliable and explainable information
        from inferred knowledge. Unlike black-box models, ontology-driven inference
        enables traceability of results through explicit rules and semantic relations.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal is to ensure that inferred outcomes are not only accurate but also
        interpretable, allowing domain experts to validate results and understand
        the reasoning process behind each inference.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE 5 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Objective 5: Scalability and Performance Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        Geospatial big data is characterized by large volume, velocity, and variety.
        Therefore, an important objective of this project is to design scalable
        algorithms capable of handling large knowledge graphs efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
        This includes optimizing data storage, inference execution, and query
        processing to ensure that the proposed framework remains practical for
        real-world, large-scale geospatial applications.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OBJECTIVE 6 ================= -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Objective 6: Development of a Web-Based Inference Framework</h2>
    <p>
        The final objective is to design and implement a web-based system that
        demonstrates the proposed ontology-driven inference framework. This system
        serves as a platform for visualization, interaction, and evaluation of
        inferred geospatial knowledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        The web interface enables users to explore data, understand inference
        outcomes, and assess the effectiveness of semantic reasoning combined with
        machine learning techniques.
